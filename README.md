Overview
--------

The code in this replication package can be used to reproduce the results published in [Linsenmeier, M. (2023): [Temperature variability and long-run economic development](https://mlinsenmeier.com/research/). Journal of Environmental Economics and Management (forthcoming).

The package consists of several scripts in Python and one script in R. To run these scripts, the original data must be downloaded first from Zenodo ([https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8030398](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8030398)) and deposited in a subfolder `data`. Additional subfolders `results`, `figures`, and `tables` also need to be created.
